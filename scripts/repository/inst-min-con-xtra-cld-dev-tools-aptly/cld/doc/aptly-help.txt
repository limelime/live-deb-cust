        Looks like some keys are missing in your trusted keyring, you may consider importing them from keyserver:

        gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45
    
    gpg --export --armor CAEB3DC3BDF7FB45 | apt-key add -

    aptly publish repo -architectures='amd64,i386' -skip-signing "${REPO_NAME}" "${PUBLISH_URL_PREFIX}"
echo "aptly publish repo -architectures='amd64' -gpg-key=${aptly_private_key_id} ${REPO_NAME} ${PUBLISH_URL_PREFIX}"
