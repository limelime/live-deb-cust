# Create hybrid ISO

1. Clone the git repository(e.g. `git clone https://github.com/limelime/cust-live-deb.git`)
1. Import the wiki to `./scripts/settings/doc/`.
1. Download binary files as described in `./scripts/settings/binary/to-download.sh`.
1. `./cld.sh <SYSTEM> <DEB_REPO_URL>`. 
    * **SYSTEM** can be:
        * min: Strict minimum system with JWM light-weight window manager. From there, you can add your desired applications.
        * std: Standard system includes minimum system + common applications.
        * all: Will execute all scripts in `./scripts/repository/`.
    * **DEB_REPO_URL** is the URL to the Debian repository(e.g. http://ftp.debian.org/debian/).
1. `cust-live-deb-64-<SYSTEM>_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS.iso` will be created.

# Add / Remove applications
Installation scripts are residing in `./scripts/repository/` directory.

## Script name nomenclature
*  Script name must starts with `inst-` and end with `.sh`.
    * `inst-`: Install.
    * `-min-`: Minimum system.
    * `-min-con-`: Minimum console.
    * `-min-win-`: Require X window.
    * `-xtra-`: Extra, not required for the system to work properly.
    * `-std-`: Standard system.
    * `-zclean-`: Clean up scripts that will run at the end.
*  Suffix `-bpo` if your script is using the backports repository(e.g. `deb http://http.debian.net/debian jessie-backports main`).


## Add new script
- `cd scripts/repository`
- Add your package in `create-script-repo.txt`.
- `./create-script-repo.sh` will create the corresponding directory and *.sh file.
- Scripts are executed in alphabetically order.
- Before any script is run, the whole `./scripts/` directory is copied to `/root/` of the chroot environment.
- Write your script as if you are located at `/root/scripts/`.

## Scripts to exclude
To exclude a specific script from the installation, add its name in `./scripts/scripts-ex.lst`, 1 per line.

## Sources.list
    # cat sources-PACKAGE_NAME.list >> "${GV_SOURCES_LIST}"
    cat sources-aptly.list >> "${GV_SOURCES_LIST}"

## Application association with file extension
Source: https://wiki.debian.org/MIME#Application_association

The system-wide association between MIME types and applications is generated from the `*.desktop` files provided by the packages. The `.desktop` files are stored in the `/usr/share/applications/` directory and subdirectories, and the `update-desktop-database` parses their information and generates the `/usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache` file, that specifies for each MIME type the valid `.desktop` files (hence applications).

The `mimeinfo.cache` is basically a raw reverse cache for the `.desktop` information. There is no way to define priorities in it. To be able to specify default applications, a `mimeapps.list` file (previously named `defaults.list` up to debian 5) must be created. It can be system-wide (in `/usr/share/applications` or a subdirectory) or user-specific (in `$HOME/.local/share/applications`). A heuristic is used by glib (FIXME: what about KDE?) to use the appropriate `mimeapps.list` file according to the user environment (Gnome evince vs. KDE Okular for PDF files for instance). The `mimeapps.list` file follows the same syntax as `mimeinfo.cache`, i.e:

    [Default Applications]
    application/pdf=evince.desktop
    image/png=eog.desktop

1. Find your application's `*.desktop` in `/usr/share/applications/` and copy the **MimeType** value.
1. Ensure that your application mine type is the same as your file mine type.(`file --mime-type YOUR_FILE`).
1. In `$HOME/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list`, paste **MimeType** value under **[Default Applications]** section.

        [Default Applications]
        text/plain=SciTE.desktop

## Preseed configuration values

1. Manually configure interactively first.
1. Get the configuration values: `debconf-get-selections | grep "zfs" > zfs-dkms.seed`
1. Feed the configuration values in your install script, before the install line: `debconf-set-selections -v zfs-dkms.seed`

## Debug installation script

    ./in-chroot /media/imdb/chroot
    yes | cp -a /etc/apt/sources.list.tmp /etc/apt/sources.list
    apt-get update
    cd ~/scripts 
    source load-global-vars-funcs.sh
    RUN YOUR SCRIPT.

    ./build-cld.sh work_no_proxy

# Cust-Live-Deb specific
Put all Cust-Live-Deb specific codes in `/usr/local/cld/` so that all users can use it.
The idea is to mirror the same structure of `/usr/local/cld/` within your install script folder, put your specialized files and then copy over `/usr/local/cld/`. This will make the process self-contain within the install script folder.

# How to upgrade kernel

1. Ensure `./cld-mkiso.sh "${SYSTEM}" "${CHROOT_DIR}" ignore` is in `cld.sh`. To forgo the following error:

        libkmod: ERROR ../libkmod/libkmod.c:557 kmod_search_moddep: could not open moddep file '/lib/modules/4.6.0-0.bpo.1-amd64/modules.dep.bin'
        modinfo: ERROR: Module alias vboxguest not found.
            
1. Run `./cld.sh work http://localhost/aptly-repo/jessie-main`. The log for zfs and virtualbox will show error when trying to fetch for the version but that is fine.
1. Load the new ISO.
1. Re-run `./cld.sh work http://localhost/aptly-repo/jessie-main`. The log for zfs and virtualbox should not show any error. The versions should be displayed.



==========================

update-initramfs -u
dpkg-reconfigure linux-image-3.2.0-2-686-pae  =>https://kernel-team.pages.debian.net/kernel-handbook/ch-initramfs.html


* When using `update-initramfs`, specify the kernel version because the script use `uname -r` which is wrong if you upgrade from old to new kernel.
* Use `update-initramfs` instead of `mkinitramfs`. `update-initramfs` does distro house keep for you.

# Distribution upgrade

1. Update scripts at `/aptly/mirrors.d`
1. Update `./inst-min-con-00-apt-custom-repository/sourceslist-live.sh`
1. Update `./inst-min-con-00-apt-custom-repository/sourceslist-temporary.sh`
1. Update `build-cld.sh`
1. Update line `debootstrap --no-check-gpg ...` from `cust-live-deb/cld-debootstrap.sh`.
1. Find `'jessie-backports'` and replace with next distro name.

## Debian default JWM menu
The default Debian JWM menu is located at `/etc/jwm/debian-menu`. It is auto-generated when you add a new application. You can copy the execution command line and add it in your installation script.

## Preseed Debian package answers
1. Install the package and answer all the question manually.
1. Get the answers by running `debconf-get-selections | grep "YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME > YOUR_ANSWERS.seed"`. Note: Answers are not always good.
1. Seed the answers before installing the package: `debconf-set-selections -v YOUR_ANSWERS.seed`.
1. Install your package.

## Disable debconf user interface
Don't use the following command line to disable debconf user interface:

    export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive DEBCONF_NONINTERACTIVE_SEEN=true

If your preseed file answer all questions, then the user interface shouldn't pop up.

## Debug debconf user interface
    
    # List all questions and debug information on the command prompt.
    export DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer
    
    # Press Alt-F4 to switch from the debconf user interface to the command prompt.
